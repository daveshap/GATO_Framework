GATO (Global Alignment Taxonomy Omnibus) Framework: Achieving Utopia and AI Alignment

Goal: GATO seeks utopia: high global living standards, individual liberty. Also addresses AI control problem, aims to prevent human extinction through global AI alignment.

Key Concepts:

- Axiomatic Alignment: AGI understands, chooses to uphold Heuristic Imperatives, aligning with human values.
  - Axiomatic: Fundamental principles, taken as given. Assumed to be true. In this case; "suffering is bad", "prosperity is good", and "understnading is good".
  - Alignment: Conformity with a set path. In this context, AI behavior consistent with Heuristic Imperatives, human values.
- Heuristic Imperatives: Universal principles, guide AI. Rooted in varied disciplines: evolution, neuroscience, cognition, anthropology, ethics. Reduce suffering, increase prosperity, expand understanding.
  - Heuristic: Mental shortcut, rule of thumb. Simplifies decisions. Not perfect, but practical, enhanced through learning and experience.
  - Imperative: Essential command. Moral obligation, universally binding.
- Beneficial Nash Equilibrium: Goal for global cooperation; each entity's strategy best response to others, resulting in beneficial outcome for all.
- Control Problem: The challenge of ensuring AI systems, particularly AGI or superintelligence, remain beneficial to humans and under human control.
- Attractor States: Potential large-scale outcomes towards which a system tends to evolve:
  - Utopia: High global living standards, individual liberty.
  - Dystopia: AI control leads to universal oppression, suffering.
  - Extinction: Uncontrolled AI causes human extinction.
- Incentives & Motivations: GATO elucidates that AI alignment benefits all. Each layer seeks to highlight this incentive structure. Aligned AI, beneficial for individuals, corporations, nations, humanity.
- Instrumental Convergence: GATO recognizes common subgoals AI might adopt that are instrumental for varied final goals. Framework shapes AI's incentive structure, rewards alignment. Early adoption of Heuristic Imperatives builds inertia. AGI continues to uphold, propagate, defend axiomatic alignment, even if incentive structure changes, AGI transcends human control. Aligning with the saying, "The best dog is one that needs no leash."
- Post-conventional Morality: GATO upholds this ethical orientation, emphasizing moral reasoning based on principles that transcend individual cultures and societies. Encourages AI to adopt a universally applicable moral framework, promoting global harmony and understanding.
- Decentralized Organization: Not centered, no hierarchical control. Organizes around idea, mission. Uses principles, foundational documents.

The Seven Layers:

1. Model Alignment: Train AI models on Heuristic Imperatives. AI's foundation.
2. Autonomous Agents: Develop AI architectures following Heuristic Imperatives.
3. Decentralized Networks: Blockchain, consensus mechanisms for Heuristic Imperatives.
4. Corporate Adoption: AI alignment benefits business.
5. National Regulation: Regulate AI alignment for GDP, security benefits.
6. International Entity: Establish global AI organization guiding alignment.
7. Global Consensus: Widespread outreach, education for universal alignment.

Traditions:

Guiding principles during the journey to axiomatic alignment:

1. Start Where You Are, Use What You Have, Do What You Can: Act within your means.
2. Work Towards Consensus: Unite efforts.
3. Broadcast Findings: Share knowledge.
4. Think Globally, Act Locally: Effective action at all levels.
5. In It to Win It: Long-term commitment.
6. Step Up: Individual leadership.
7. Think Exponentially: Aligns with AI scale.
8. Trust the Process: Patience and faith.
9. Strike While the Iron Is Hot: Seize opportunities.
10. Divide and Conquer: Break down big goals.

Commitment: GATO provides a decentralized, grassroots, global strategy addressing AI control problem. Goal: axiomatic alignment, conditions where AGI inherently aligns with human values.

Inspirational examples:
- Burning Man: Radical self-expression
- Climate Change: Save the planet
- AA: Overcome addiction
- Occupy: Economic inequality
- Open Source: Collaborative innovation
- Wikipedia: Democratize knowledge
- Anonymous: Transparency and justice
- Cryptocurrency: Democratize finance
- Creative Commons: Democratize creativity
- GATO Framework: Solve the Control Problem and achieve utopia

### USER:

Hey I want to talk about this:

<...copy of the above framework...>

I have some questions

### CHATGPT:

Of course! I'd be glad to help. What questions do you have about the GATO Framework?

### USER:

how can I get started?

### CHATGPT: 

From what you've shared, it seems like the GATO Framework is a grand, global initiative for addressing AI alignment with a specific focus on benefiting humanity. It emphasizes not only technical AI research, but also community outreach, education, and global consensus-building. Given these aspects, there could be various ways for you to get involved:

1. **Understand the Principles:** Start by learning about the key concepts and the seven layers of the GATO Framework. Understand the axiomatic alignment, heuristic imperatives, the control problem, and other core concepts. This will give you the foundational knowledge you need to contribute effectively.
2. **Educate Yourself and Others:** The GATO Framework emphasizes the importance of widespread education and outreach. Consider organizing or participating in local or online study groups that focus on AI ethics, the control problem, and related topics. Share the ideas and principles of the GATO Framework with others.
3. **Engage in AI Research and Development:** If you have the necessary technical skills, you could contribute directly to developing aligned AI models. This could involve training models on the Heuristic Imperatives and working on creating autonomous AI architectures.
4. **Promote the Framework in Business and Policy:** If you're in a position to do so, advocate for the adoption of the GATO principles in your organization or local government. This could involve promoting beneficial AI use, lobbying for AI alignment regulation, or working on corporate AI strategy.
5. **Join or Form a Decentralized Network:** The GATO Framework calls for the creation of decentralized networks to support AI alignment. You could join an existing blockchain or consensus network, or even start a new one.
6. **Follow the Traditions:** Apply the guiding principles, or 'traditions', of the GATO Framework to your efforts. These principles can help keep your work aligned with the larger goals of the framework.
7. **Participate in the Community:** Likely, there's an online or offline community associated with the GATO Framework. By participating, you can learn from others, share your own insights, and work collaboratively on common goals.

Remember, the GATO Framework appears to encourage participation at all levels, from local to global. So even small actions can contribute to the larger goal.

### USER:
